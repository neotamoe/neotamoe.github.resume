# Prime Digital Academy Resume for Application

This project was done in late January 2017 as part of my application for the Full Stack Engineering program at Prime Digital Academy.  The application only uses HTML and CSS.  

## Getting started
I can't foresee a reason for anyone to ever to want to fork or clone this repo, but if you do, nothing special is needed to get started.  If you are looking for an updated resume, head over to http://neotamoe.com or http://linkedin.com/in/neotamoe or http://github.com/neotamoe
